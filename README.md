Hereâ€™s a more readable version:

1. The file **"main.py"** is used to start the application.

2. The file **"data_insertion.py"** inserts data into the MySQL schema **(taufashion_10)**. Please note that the logic generates random data for certain fields, so the data used might differ slightly. The exact data we used can be found in the **"data_creation\data"** directory, where each **.xlsx** file corresponds to a table, with the file name matching the table name.

3. The path **"sql\dll"** contains all the DLLs for the tables in our schema.
