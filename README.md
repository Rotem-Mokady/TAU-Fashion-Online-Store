1) The file "main.py" will activate the application.
2) The file "data_insertion.py" is the file that insert the data to the 
   MySQL schema (taufashion_10). Please note the logic generates random data for some fields,
   so probably the data that we used is a bit different.
   The exact data that we used is available in "data_creation\data" directory, when each xlsx file 
   includes the data of the table that has the same name as the filename.
3) The path "sql\dll" includes all the dlls of the tables in our schema.
